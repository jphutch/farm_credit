	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the market microstructure related to the Farm Credit System (FCS), Commercial Banks (CB) and Farm Services Administration (FSA). The commercial banks frequently call out the FCS as having an unfair advantage in the agricultural finance market place due to tax exempt bonds, and an implied guarantee of those bonds. This paper addresses the issue by examining the interrelationships since 1939, while addressing the historically distinctive roles that the FCS, CB and FSA have played in the US agricultural credit market. Design/methodology/approach There are two components to our model. The first is the estimation of short and long run credit demand elasticities, as well as land elasticities. These are estimated from a dynamic duality model using seemingly unrelated regression. The point elasticity measures are then used as independent variables in least square regressions, combined with farm specific and related macro variables, for the Cornbelt states. The dependent variable is the year-over-year changes in paired FCS, CB and FSA loans. Findings The genesis of the FCS was to provide credit to farmers in good and bad years. Therefore, we expected to see a countercyclical relationship between FCS and CB. This is found for the farm crisis years in the 1980s but is not a continuous characteristic of FCS lending. In good times the FCS and CB appear to compete, albeit with differentiated market segmentation into short- and long-term credit. The FSA, which was established to provide tertiary support to both the FCS and CB, appears to be responding as designed, with greater activity in bad years. The authors find the elasticity measures to be economically significant. Research limitations/implications The authors conclude that the market microstructure of the agricultural credit market in the US is important. Our analysis applies a broader definition of market microstructure for institutions and intermediaries and reveals that further research examining the economic frictions caused by comparative bond vs deposit funding of agricultural credit is important. Originality/value The authors believe that this is the first paper to examine agricultural finance through the market microstructure lens. In addition our long-term data measures allow us to examine the economics through various sub-periods. Finally, we believe that our introduction of credit and land demand elasticities into a comparative credit model is also a first.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators.

Importantly, the purely statistical approach uses pretesting and thus, generates the wrong standard errors. Moreover, we underline the dangers of implicitly or explicitly accepting the null hypothesis when failing to reject the absence of a differential pre-trend.},

My difference-in-difference specification with tile fixed effects exploits variation in camp openings and tile proximity to camps. F-tests on event study pre-trends provide support for the satisfaction of parallel trends prior to camp exposure. I find that within the rainforest biome, camps are associated with a small reduction in extensive margin forest loss (i.e., land clearing) and a small increase in intensive margin forest loss (i.e., gradual reductions in canopy cover). In the grasslands biome, camps lead to small increases in forest loss at the intensive margin but have no impact on the extensive margin.},

We show that treatment eﬀect on the treated-type parameters can be identiﬁed under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting diﬀerences in these parameters across diﬀerent values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment eﬀect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way ﬁxed-eﬀect speciﬁcations can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suﬀer from these drawbacks. Our results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, which are both common in empirical work.},

Results show that access to credit has positive but imprecisely estimated effects on adoption of modern varieties (MV) of rice as well as rice yield. The microcredit program increases crop farm income but has no significant effect on total income or expenditure. Although the program does not have a significant effect on most economic outcomes, it demonstrates an increase in farm activities among the targeted farmers.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to empirically analyse the effects of governmentally promoted credit access on the investment behaviour of credit-rationed farmers in Poland. This is done by an econometric analysis of cross-sectional Polish farm household data. A Probit analysis revealed that the reputation of the borrower, but not the availability of land as collateral, had an effect of credit rationing. The estimates of an investment equation suggest that access to subsidised credit has a statistically significant role in determining investment behaviour of farmers. In various specifications of the credit-investment relationship, the average marginal effect of credit on investment was smaller than one, which implies that credit is partly used for purposes other than productive investment. Furthermore, investment volume is negatively related to farm size. A governmental policy which aims to promote productive investment should emphasise lending in larger amounts without discriminating against small farms.},

Deposit insurance amplified the impact of rising crop prices on bank portfolios, while higher minimum capital requirements dampened the effects.

This article draws on these developments to appraise the case for government intervention in rural financial markets in developing countries and to discover whether the theoretical findings can be used to identify directives for policy. Before debating the when and how of intervention, the article defines market failure, emphasizing the need to consider the full array of constraints that combine to make a market work imperfectly. The various reasons for market failure are discussed and set in the context in which credit markets function in developing countries. The article then looks at recurrent problems that may be cited as failures of the market justifying intervention. Among these problems are enforcement; imperfect information, especially adverse selection and moral hazard; the risk of bank runs; and the need for safeguards against the monopoly power of some lenders. The review concludes with a discussion of interventions, focusing on the learning process that must take place for financial markets to operate effectively.},

Although the legislation establishing the earlier agencies was controversial and attracted general notice, that setting up the production credit system received comparatively little attention. This paper describes briefly the structure of the system and outlines the scale of loaning operations to date. At the end of 1934 it seems probable that the system had approximately one-tenth as many loans outstanding for agricultural purposes as did the commercial banks. The competitive position of the system, particularly in relation to country banks, is discussed in some detail. Attention is also given to the perplexing problem which the system faces in its efforts to maintain a uniform loan rate for all parts of the country.},

An extension of mean-variance portfolio theory shows how credit risks combine with other financial and business risks to determine total risk. Empirical evidence from lender surveys about risks shows that farmers' credit is positively correlated with changes in farm income, although the correlation is stronger for capital credit than for operating credit, and that variability in fund availability from rural banks has contributed to high credit risks.},

It discusses the place of policy intervention in the financial development of developing countries and, through a case study of an innovative bank, illustrates the nature and characteristics of the financial innovations necessary for financing small enterprises and mobilizing resources from low-and-middle-income groups. Such financial innovations are shown to reduce transaction costs and risk and as a result to bring about widening, deeping and intergration of capital markets. This process accelerates economic development through a favorable impact on savings, investment and output.},

Consequently, liberalization of financial markets may be insufficient to guarantee small farms access to credit.},

In contrast, the AAA seems to have had a negative effect on retail sales, suggesting that nonlandowners in the farm sector suffered disproportionate declines in income as a result of the AAA.},

Large banks are also more able to cope with distance-related entry costs than small banks.

After exploring its incidence with respect to wealth, we show that risk rationing has important policy implications. Specifically, land titling will be only partially effective because it does not enhance producers' willingness to offer up the collateral needed to secure loans under moral hazard constraints. Efforts to enhance agricultural investment and the working of agricultural credit markets must step beyond land titling and also deal with risk.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes determinants of farmers’ participation and credit rationing using survey data from Ghana. The Garrett Ranking Technique is used to analyze farmers’ reasons for participation or non-participation in credit programs. A probit regression model is also applied to estimate factors influencing farm households’ participation in credit programs. Farm households participate in credit programs because of improved loan access for farming purposes and savings mobilization. Fear of loan default and lack of savings are reasons for non-participation in credit programs. Furthermore, membership in farmer based organizations and the household head’s formal education are positively associated with farmers’ participation in credit programs. The likelihood of farmers being credit rationed (i.e., they were rejected or the amount of credit they applied for was reduced) is less likely among higher income farmers and members of organizations. Policy strategies aiming to improve credit access should educate farmers and strengthen farmer based organizations that could serve as entry points for credit providers. Such market smart strategies have the potential to improve farmers’ access to timely credit and to reduce rural poverty.},

  abstract = {This paper uses the lender–borrower relationship to provide insight into the impirical estimation of loan demand/contract curves for agricultural loans. Loan demand is shown to be determined partly by lenders’willingness to provide debt. The implicit solution to the loan contract curve in the lender–borrower relationship is derived from the cumulative probability distribution function of loan losses, which is the same measure used as the dependent variable in credit scoring models. Consequently, empirical estimation of loan demand can be obtained from credit scoring models. This paper presents the theory and then provides loan demand estimates and elasticities using Farm Credit Corporation cross-sectional and time-series data. Empirical estimates indicate the possibility of a backward-bending loan demand curve, which may indicate some credit ationing in agriculture.},

We analyze data collected in a survey of small firms by the Small Business Administration. The primary benefit of building close ties with an institutional creditor is that the availability of financing increases. We find smaller effects on the price of credit. Attempts to widen the circle of relationships by borrowing from multiple lenders increases the price and reduces the availability of credit. In sum, relationships are valuable and appear to operate more through quantities rather than prices.},

We estimate the parameters of the model using a “grouped fixed-effects” estimator that minimizes a least squares criterion with respect to all possible groupings of the cross-sectional units. Recent advances in the clustering literature allow for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our estimator is consistent as both dimensions of the panel tend to infinity, and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns of unobserved heterogeneity in the study of the link between income and democracy across countries.},

But land grant college counties see only small and imprecisely estimated improvements in agricultural performance, measured by yield and output, relative to runner-up counties. I discuss several alternative interpretations of these findings. By comparing the establishment of land grant colleges to non-land grant colleges, I show that land grants appear to cause smaller increases in local invention, population, and agricultural output, but larger increases in agricultural yields and new crop varieties. The effect of land grant colleges on local innovations is largest, even relative to non-land grant colleges, following the passage of legislation that increases funding to agricultural research.},

	abstract = {Purpose – Farm Credit is a major provider of credit to agricultural producers in Oklahoma and nationally. The decision to place a new Farm Credit office reduces borrower search and travel costs and should increase loan volume. The purpose of this paper is to model the new loan volume as function of distance from east central Oklahoma county centroids to Farm Credit offices. The model is then used to predict the impact of placing new offices in underserved areas. Design/methodology/approach – County aggregate new loan volume is regressed on distances to Farm Credit branch and field offices and other variables expected to impact agricultural loan volume. The estimated model is used to predict new loan volume impact of adding additional branch and field offices in counties that did not have these offices. Confidence intervals are used to measure the significance of predicted loan volumes. Findings – Distances from county centroids to both branch and field offices were found to significantly reduce new loan volume. The results were used to simulate the addition of new branch and field offices. The simulation predicted the added annual new loan volume associated with office additions. Practical implications – Using spatial models, Farm Credit of east central Oklahoma and other agricultural lenders can better plan for expansion (or consolidation). These models indicate counties where annual new loan volume will likely be higher (or lower for consolidation) than other nearby counties. The result can be improved borrower access and system financial performance. Originality/value – While spatial modeling has been utilized in other sectors, little has been done relative to agricultural credit access and impact on loan volume. The model here explicitly models the impact that distance to Farm Credit offices have on annual new loan volume.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide evidence of the positive impact of the FCS lending on farm incomes which should be useful to policymakers as they consider reforms and further support for this 100-year-old major agricultural lender.
The authors construct a panel for the 1991-2010 period from the FCS financial statements and evaluate how lending by the FCS institutions has affected farm incomes and farm output. The authors use fixed effects estimations and control for credit by other agricultural lenders as well as the stock of capital, prices, and interest rates. Since previous work suggests that rural financial markets are segmented and the FCS serves larger full-time farmers with mostly real-estate backed loans, the authors evaluate the impacts of farm real-estate backed loans and of short-term agricultural loans separately for a shorter period for which the data is available. The authors also perform robustness checks with alternative estimation techniques.
The authors found a positive association between credit by the FCS institutions and farm income and output. The magnitude of the estimated impact is larger during the 1990s than in the 2000s.
The positive link between the FCS institutions’ credit and farm incomes and output supports the notion that the FCS lending was beneficial to farmers. The evidence also supports the segmentation hypothesis of rural financial markets. The financial reports data for 1991-2010 are from the ACAs and FLCAs aggregated on the regional level because there is no clear way to classify FCS lending to a more disaggregate level like the state. The authors also assemble and analyze a state-level data set that contains state-level balance sheet data for the period 1991-2003.
The authors are not aware of another work that directly links (real estate and non-real estate) credit by FCS institutions to agricultural output and farm incomes.},

	abstract = {Purpose - Many associations in the Farm Credit System, which are financial cooperatives, pay their member-borrowers a cash patronage payment based on the amount of loan volume with the association. In today's competitive lending environment, some Farm Credit associations have offered lower interest rates on new loans but these new member-borrowers have to forgo their cash patronage payment to receive this new, lower-interest rate loan. The purpose of this paper is to identify Farm Credit member-borrowers' preferences for patronage refunds received as a cash payment versus lower fixed real estate interest rates. Design/methodology/approach - Preferences for patronage refunds or lower fixed interest rates are elicited from Farm Credit Services of East Central Oklahoma member-borrowers via conjoint analysis. Findings - Results show that member-borrowers strongly prefer patronage refunds compared to lower fixed interest rates. Originality/value - This paper fulfills a need to better understand patronage refund programs within the Farm Credit System.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of major historical developments in agricultural finance, with particular emphasis on agricultural credit. It reviews the development of Raiffeisen and related banks that emerged in Germany and Europe throughout the nineteenth century and how the cooperative banking system made its way into the banking system of the USA in the early twentieth century. The paper emphasizes the role of the state in the developing of agricultural credit, especially with respect to farm mortgages, securitization, and bond structures.,This paper presents a historical synthesis of historical literature on agricultural credit.,This paper shows the direct linkage between the developments in Raiffeisen credit cooperatives and the Farm Credit System (FCS) and details the emergence of the land banks, farm credit banks, agricultural bonds and the role of joint-stock banks in agricultural credit policy.,In total, 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the passing of the 1916 Federal Farm Loan Act which set in motion the USs’ first Government Sponsored Enterprise and catalyzed the formation of the FCS as it operates today to provide credit to farmers and rural communities on a cooperative basis. Although there are a few wonderful books written on certain aspects of the FCS the story of how the FCS was initiated and the many struggles it faced up to the 1933 Act has not been told often enough. This paper tells the story of the evolution of agricultural credit that ultimately led to the formation of the FCS.},
